# StrangersThings

My project for Strangers things.

Overall I feel like I learned a lot and accomplished a lot of the project guidelines. I have a weird bug when hitting the browser refresh button while on the profile page. I feel like it's something to do with the token but not sure and didn't have enough time to figure it out.
I also did not get the Search component working right. Didn't have time to continue to work on it.

I hope I did enough to pass.

Thanks.
