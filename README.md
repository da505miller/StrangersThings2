# StrangersThings

My project for Strangers things.

Overall I feel like I learned a lot and accomplished a lot of the project guidelines. 
I have a weird bug when hitting the browser refresh button while on the profile page. 
I feel like it's something to do with the token but not sure and didn't have enough time to figure it out. 
I also did not get the Search component working right. Didn't have time to continue to work on it.
I would have also liked to do more css to make the appearance of the website look better but I ran out of time and wanted to concentrate on the logic.


Thanks.

Derek Miller
